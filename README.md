Buttons in Android using onClick and onClickListener
Buttons in Android A button consists of text or an icon (or both text and an icon) that communicates what action occurs when the user touches it. There are two ways of using buttons in android

onClick In the XML file
OnClickListener In the MainActivity java file
In the code I gave below, the first button(id= button1) is by onclick and the second one(id= button2) is by OnClickListener.
